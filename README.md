# Exercise #17: Secrets CLI & API

## Exercise details

Created a package that stores secrets - things like API keys - in an encrypted file. Then create a CLI that will make it possible to set and get these secrets via the command line as well.

*The CLI is a wrapper around the `secret` package that uses a secrets file in your home directory*

*CLI is based on Cobra*
